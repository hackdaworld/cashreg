# CashReg

[CashReg](https://cashreg.org) aims to become a simple cash register (point of sales, POS) app primarily but not exclusively for gastronomy.

## How it all began and where it should go

There are lots of POS apps in the playstore.
So why the whole effort of creating yet another one?

At the time the project started, it looked like a new app which best meets the demands of a small gastronomy needs to be written from scratch.
In fact there was no suitable open source candidate available at that time.

Well, and now it's there, *CashReg*.
It's dirty. It's not comfortable over all. It lacks features.
Some parts even can't be configured within the app but must be changed in the source or by importing the respective configuration from an external database (originally intended for safety backups and analysis). 

Instead of painstakingly driving forward the project in private, it would be great to see *CashReg* evolving in whatever direction by the influence of the open source developer community. 
By going open source (it actually always was) and public (it's on github now) the quality and usability of *CashReg* might improve and new features and functionalities might arise.

## Important notes 
 
** Due to limited free time, I am cleaning and uploading the source step by step. Feel free to contact me if you can't wait to start hacking. **

This hint will be removed as soon as everything is in place and development can start.

### Disclaimer

** Although the app avoids abuse by design (i.e. every single transaction is stored and can't be deleted from within the app), there is no guarantee that the software (and hardware it is innstalled on) complies with the legal requirements of the respective authorities in your country. **
